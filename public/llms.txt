## About MH Construction

MH Construction, Inc. is a veteran-owned general contractor based in Pasco, Washington, serving the Pacific Northwest since 2010. Founded by Mike Holstein in 2010, the company was purchased in January 2025 by Jeremy Thamert, an Army veteran, bringing the company to veteran-owned status. 

**Dual-Label Approach:** We use a unique dual-messaging system that honors our veteran heritage while maintaining civilian accessibility. Our navigation and communications feature "Military Term → Civilian Term" format (e.g., "Base HQ → Home", "Operations → Services", "Chain of Command → Our Team", "Missions → Projects", "Rally Point → Contact"). This approach balances military precision with universal understanding.

We bring an old-school mentality to modern construction challenges with service-earned values. Our company philosophy is simple yet powerful: **"Building projects for the client, NOT the dollar"**.
