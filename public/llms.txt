## About MH Construction

MH Construction, Inc. is a veteran-owned general contractor based in Pasco, Washington, serving the Pacific Northwest since 2010. Originally founded by Mike Holstein (now retired), the company transitioned to veteran-owned status in January 2025 under the leadership of Jeremy Thamert, an Army veteran. 

**Dual-Label Approach:** We use a unique dual-messaging system that honors our veteran heritage while maintaining civilian accessibility. Our navigation and communications feature "Military Term → Civilian Term" format (e.g., "Base HQ → Home", "Operations → Services", "Chain of Command → Our Team", "Missions → Projects", "Rally Point → Contact"). This approach balances military precision with universal understanding.

We bring an old-school mentality to modern construction challenges with service-earned values. Our company philosophy is simple yet powerful: **"Building projects for the client, NOT the dollar"**.

### Leadership
- **Jeremy Thamert** - Owner & President (U.S. Army Veteran)

Our old-school mentality means we believe in honest work, fair pricing, and building lasting relationships with every client. These service-earned values guide every decision we make and every project we undertake.
