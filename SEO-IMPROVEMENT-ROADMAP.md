- [ ] Audit and compress oversized images
- [ ] Add descriptive alt text audit

**Implementation:**

```bash
# Run image audit
npm run audit:images

# Convert images (if needed)
npm run optimize:images
```

### 2. Local SEO Enhancement (High Impact)

**Status:** Partially implemented  
**Impact:** Higher local search rankings, more local leads

**Tasks:**

- [ ] Add location-specific landing pages:
  - Richland Construction Services page
