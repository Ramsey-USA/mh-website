## For Developers: Complete Workflow

**New to this project?** Follow this exact path:

1. **Read this README** (you're here) - Project overview, tech stack, setup
2. **Study the [Homepage](src/app/page.tsx)** as your reference standard - See
   [Homepage Documentation](docs/technical/homepage.md) for complete breakdown
3. **Review [Unified Component Standards](docs/branding/standards/unified-component-standards.md)
   v7.0.0** - Complete design system (colors, typography, components)
4. **Study [Component Cheatsheet](docs/development/quick-reference/component-cheatsheet.md)** -
   Copy-paste patterns matching homepage style
5. **Use [Page Template Guide](docs/development/standards/page-template-guide.md)** - Complete boilerplate for new pages
6. **Build your page** using StandardSection template and cheatsheet patterns to match homepage cohesiveness
7. **Audit with [Page Compliance Checklist](docs/development/standards/page-compliance-checklist.md)** -
   150+ items to verify homepage-level quality
8. **Deploy** following standards

**Key Principle:** Your page should feel like it belongs on the same site as the
homepage - same visual weight, spacing, animations, and polish.

### Recent Improvements (March 2026)

- **Mar 25:** Dependency audit — `npm audit` now reports 4 vulnerabilities (0 critical, 2 high,
  2 moderate): `fast-xml-parser` entity expansion bypass (via `wrangler` devDep); `flatted`
  prototype pollution (partial override applied — awaiting upstream 3.4.2+ release); Next.js
  2× moderate (HTTP request smuggling in rewrites, unbounded `next/image` disk cache — fix
  requires Next.js >15.5.13 when available); `vercel` devDep fully removed; overrides updated
  (`cookie@0.7.2`, `glob@>=11.0.0`, `flatted@>=3.4.0`, `undici@>=7.24.0`, `yauzl@>=3.2.1`)

- **Mar 25:** Build type errors resolved — fixed 5 categories of pre-existing type errors exposed
  by TypeScript strict mode: (1) `rateLimit` is a middleware factory (`rateLimit(config)(handler)`) —
  4 API routes (`geolocation`, `consultations`, `job-applications`, `functions/[functionName]`) were
  incorrectly calling it as `await rateLimit(request, config)`; (2) `newsletter/route.ts` —
  `DbClient.query<T>()` returns `T[]` directly, not `{ results: T[] }`; (3) `PageNavigation.tsx` —
  `useIsMobile()` returns `boolean | null` (SSR-safe), coerced to `boolean | undefined` with `?? undefined`
  for `getNavigationLabel`; (4) `middleware/security.ts` — `getRouteConfig` fallback replaced
  indexing into `Record<string,…>` (possibly `undefined`) with an explicit `{ logAll: false }` object;
  build now clean: ~28s, 37 static pages, 211 kB shared bundle, zero type errors

- **Mar 25:** Codebase audit and hardening — fixed CORS origins in `security-manager.ts`
  (was pointing to stale `mh-construction.com` domain); fixed SW precache paths for location
  pages (`/pasco` etc. → `/locations/pasco`); fixed geolocation API to read from Workers `cf`
  object instead of non-existent CF headers (only `CF-IPCountry` is a real header); fixed
  `X-Frame-Options` in `public/_headers` from `SAMEORIGIN` to `DENY` (consistent with
  security-manager); fixed CI Node version `20` → `22` (matches `engines` in package.json);
  fixed CI `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` missing `www` prefix; added `JWT_SECRET`,
  `ADMIN_MATT_PASSWORD`, `ADMIN_JEREMY_PASSWORD`, `EMAIL_FROM`, R2 bucket bindings, KV
  bindings, Cloudflare dashboard safety settings (Rocket Loader OFF, HTML minify OFF, SSL
  Full strict, Always HTTPS) to deployment checklist; flagged placeholder Google Maps embed
  URL on contact page (requires real Place ID + Maps Embed API key)

- **Mar 25:** Migrated deployment from Cloudflare Pages (`mhc-gc-website`) to Cloudflare Workers
  (`mhc-v2-website.twelthmann.workers.dev`) — `wrangler.toml` updated to Workers model (`main =
.open-next/worker.js`, `[assets]` binding); `deploy` script changed from
  `wrangler pages deploy --project-name=mhc-v2-website` to `wrangler deploy`; `sw.js`
  `isCloudflareAsset()` extended to cover `workers.dev` preview URLs; cloudflare-guide.md
  updated to v3.0.0 with new dashboard paths and first-time setup checklist

- **Mar 16:** Cloudflare Pages build failure diagnosed and resolved — root cause: build command
  (`npm run build`) was not set in the Cloudflare Pages dashboard, causing CF to skip the build
  step and fail with "Output directory `.open-next/assets` not found"; fix is dashboard-only
  (Settings → Builds & deployments → Build command = `npm run build`); also requires `CI=true`
  env var to prevent husky `prepare` script from failing in the CF build environment; updated
  [Cloudflare Deployment Guide](docs/deployment/cloudflare-guide.md) to v2.0.0 — rewrote
  entirely to reflect current OpenNext adapter setup, accurate build command, dashboard
  requirements, and troubleshooting for the "no build command" failure mode

- **Mar 16:** Build pipeline optimizations — moved `outputFileTracingExcludes` to top-level key in
  `next.config.js` (promoted out of `experimental` in Next.js 15; was emitting a config warning); excludes
  build-tool packages (`@swc`, `webpack`, `typescript`, `eslint`, `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, etc.) from the
  Next.js trace step; disabled Next.js telemetry unconditionally via `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` at
  config load time; made `prepare` script CI-aware so husky is skipped in Cloudflare Pages builds
  (`node -e "if (process.env.CI) process.exit(0)" && husky`); updated `compatibility_date` in
  `wrangler.toml` to `2026-03-15`; deleted dead `/api/auth/login` and `/api/auth/refresh` routes (both
  always returned 401 — `getUserById` / `verifyCredentials` were stubs; superseded by
  `/api/auth/admin-login`); removed deleted routes from `MUTATION_ROUTES` in `api-cache-security.test.ts`;
  fixed `module.context` null-safety in webpack chunk naming (webpack 5 can pass `null` context);
  build: zero warnings, zero errors, 37/37 static pages, 210 kB shared bundle; test count: 56 → 54;
  remaining dashboard-only items: enable `.next/cache` build cache path in CF Pages dashboard,
  add `HUSKY=0` env var

- **Mar 15:** Removed redundant `export const runtime = "edge"` declarations from 18 API route files —
  Cloudflare Workers is inherently an edge runtime so the declarations are no-ops, but OpenNext was
  treating them as signals to bundle those routes into a separate edge function which it cannot reconcile
  with the single-Worker output model; build now completes cleanly end-to-end

- **Mar 15:** Fixed Cloudflare Pages CI — dashboard build command updated from
  `npm run build && npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages` to `npm run build`; deprecated
  `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` was running as a second step after OpenNext and failing because it
  requires `export const runtime = 'edge'` on all dynamic routes — the two adapters are mutually
  exclusive; note: `[build]` in `wrangler.toml` is not valid for Pages projects (Workers-only field);
  fix must be applied in the dashboard; deployment confirmed: 318 assets uploaded, site live

- **Mar 15:** Comprehensive build audit — production build: 32.6s, 39/39 static pages generated, zero errors;
  fixed 3 pre-existing lint issues (`OptimizedImage.tsx` — 2× missing `alt` on spread `<Image>` calls,
  `PitchDeckCTA.tsx` — `role="none"` on hover-shim div); TypeScript strict: zero errors; ESLint: zero
  warnings/errors; 56/56 tests passing; shared bundle reduced 221 kB → 211 kB

- **Mar 15:** Eighth optimization pass — deleted 2 dead `lib/utils/` modules (`keyword-matcher.ts` — written
  for removed AI/veteran systems, 14 tests; `date-utils.ts` — written for removed components, 9 tests);
  fixed pre-existing missing `JWTPayload` import in `lib/auth/jwt.ts`; 56/56 tests passing, zero TS errors,
  zero lint warnings

- **Mar 15:** Seventh optimization pass — deleted `components/veterans/` directory (`VeteranBadgeSection.tsx`,
  `index.ts`) — component never imported anywhere in the codebase (the previously deleted
  `shared/VeteranBadgeSection.tsx` was a compat-wrapper; this was the original source that also had no
  consumers); 79/79 tests still passing, zero TS errors, zero lint warnings

- **Mar 15:** Sixth optimization pass — deleted 3 dead component directories (`components/slider/` —
  `BeforeAfterSlider` + `BeforeAfterGallery`, `components/ratings/` — `AggregateRating`, `components/map/`
  — `InteractiveMap` + `ServiceAreaOverview`), 7 dead files (`components/home/VideoHeroSection.tsx` &
  `PartnershipCTA.tsx`, `components/testimonials/TestimonialsWidget.tsx` & `TestimonialsSection.tsx`,
  `lib/analytics/marketing-analytics.ts`, `lib/auth/protected-route.tsx`, `lib/types/testimonials.ts`);
  cleaned 2 barrel files (`home/index.ts`, `testimonials/index.ts`); 79/79 tests still passing, zero TS
  errors, zero lint warnings

- **Mar 15:** Fifth optimization pass — deleted 11 dead files: `components/shared/` compat-wrapper directory
  (`VeteranBadgeSection.tsx`, `index.ts`), `shared-sections/AIEstimatorCTA.tsx` (AI estimator removed per business
  policy; component orphaned), `lib/seo/seo-content-fragments.ts` (never imported), `lib/utils/dynamic-imports.tsx`
  (utility only referenced in its own doc comment), `hooks/use-performance.ts` & `use-performance-optimization.ts`
  (mock implementations, hooks never called in any component), `hooks/use-scroll-animation.ts` &
  `use-scroll-depth-tracking.ts` (never imported), `hooks/use-phone-tracking.ts` (phone tracking handled via
  `EnhancedAnalytics` directly), `components/team/TeamMemberTag.tsx` (never rendered),
  `components/analytics/TrackedComponents.tsx` (`TrackedButton`/`TrackedLink`/`TrackedForm` never used — tracking goes
  through `EnhancedAnalytics` and `TrackedContactLinks`); cleaned 4 barrel files; 79/79 tests still passing, zero TS
  errors, zero lint warnings

- **Mar 15:** Integration test cleanup — deleted orphaned `booking-flow.test.ts` (multi-step booking UI was removed;
  no corresponding component exists); rewrote `authentication.test.ts` to reflect real admin auth flow
  (Matt & Jeremy via `AdminSignInModal` → `/api/auth/admin-login`) replacing unimplemented general user login tests;
  test count 95 → 79 (16 obsolete tests removed), all 79 passing

- **Mar 15:** Fourth optimization pass — deleted 7 dead `lib/performance/` modules (`caching`, `performance-manager`,
  `code-splitting`, `hooks`, `app-performance`, `lightweight-performance`, `index`, ~2,528 lines, only
  `mobile-optimizations` retained); deleted `IconLibrary.tsx` (628 lines) and its 40+ unused re-exports from the icons
  barrel; deleted `Slogan.tsx` and `slogans.ts` (~952 lines, never rendered); deleted standalone
  `csrf.ts` (194 lines, CSRF logic lives inside `security-manager`); converted 3 more pages from client to RSC
  (`team`, `public-sector`, `contact/ContactPageClient`) via `PageTrackingClient` island pattern — 4,302 lines of dead
  code removed, 95/95 tests still passing; removed Urgent page (`/urgent`) and all associated navigation links,
  sitemap entries, SEO metadata, and breadcrumb schema — page count 23 → 22; deleted stale
  `docs/examples/performance-examples.tsx` (dead usage example for the removed performance modules)

- **Mar 14:** Third optimization pass — deleted 5 dead `lib/` directories (`ai`, `cache`, `content`, `storage`, `branding`,
  ~1,600 lines); removed `components/images` compat shim directory, `QuickBookingModal`, `PerformanceDashboard`,
  and `components/activity` empty barrel; deleted dev-demo `/tracking-example` route; removed 3 unused production type
  packages (`@types/hast`, `@types/mdast`, `@types/unist`), removed unused `@playwright/test` dev dep; added missing
  `cross-env` dev dep required by `build:profile` script; cleaned `robots.txt` stale disallow entry; 95/95 tests still passing
- **Mar 14:** Second optimization pass — converted `/accessibility` to RSC (223 kB → 221 kB); deleted 5 more dead
  code files (`BlogNewsSection`, `CaseStudyTemplate`, `bundle-optimization`, `SmartFormAssistant`,
  `use-smart-form-assistant`); removed unused `@react-email/render` production dependency; cleaned up
  `CaseStudyTemplate` stale barrel export from `src/components/projects/index.ts`
- **Mar 14:** Codebase optimization pass — deleted 2 exact-duplicate page files (`CareersPageClient`, `ProjectsPageClient`),
  219 `.bak` backup artifacts, dead `FeaturesSection` and `ActivityFeed` components, entire unused chatbot component tree
  (`GlobalChatbot`, `FloatingChatbotButton`, `GlobalChatbotProvider`, `InteractiveTimeline`, chatbot lib), and removed
  `GlobalChatbotProvider` wrapper from root layout — 7 pages converted from client components to React Server Components
  (`terms`, `privacy`, `testimonials`, `veterans`, `faq`, `allies`) by replacing inline `usePageTracking` hook
  with the existing `PageTrackingClient` island pattern; fixed dead `/book` → `/contact` redirect; pruned 3 unused
  entries from `optimizePackageImports` and removed empty `swcPlugins: []` from `next.config.js`; shared bundle
  reduced from 223 kB → 221 kB with per-page hydration costs significantly lower on converted RSC pages
- **Mar 11:** GEO-proof location content — city pages (Kennewick, Richland, Pasco, Yakima/Zillah,
  Walla Walla) carry verified project cards, `hasOfferCatalog` LocalBusiness schema, and
  public-sector callout linking fire-station work to `/public-sector`
- **Mar 11:** Security hardening — API cache `Cache-Control: no-store` on mutating routes (21 tests);
  asset-integrity guard tests added; middleware SEO matcher excludes static assets; production
  audit at 0 vulnerabilities (dev-only: 15); `tar@7.5.11` and `cookie@1.1.1` CVE overrides added
- **Mar 11:** Dependency upgrades — Next.js 15.5.12, React 19.0.0, Tailwind 3.4.19,
  TypeScript 5.9.2, `markdownlint-cli2` v0.21.0, `vercel` pinned to 32.3.0
- **Mar 11:** SEO/GEO hardening — canonical host standardized to `https://www.mhc-gc.com`;
  city-priority service metadata; media sitemap expanded; Contact metadata deduped

## Dependency Maintenance Notes (March 2026)

- Production audit: `npm audit --omit=dev` reports 1 moderate vulnerability — Next.js
  (HTTP request smuggling in rewrites, unbounded `next/image` disk cache growth; fix requires
  upgrading Next.js beyond 15.5.13 when a patched release is available).
- Deployment uses `@opennextjs/cloudflare` (OpenNext Workers adapter). The legacy
  `@cloudflare/next-on-pages` adapter has been fully removed — it is mutually exclusive
  with OpenNext and required `export const runtime = 'edge'` on every dynamic route.
- `package.json` includes `overrides` to force patched versions of transitive dependencies:
  - `tar@7.5.11` (fixes high CVEs in `@mapbox/node-pre-gyp` transitive chain)
  - `cookie@0.7.2` (fixes low CVE in transitive chain)
  - `flatted@>=3.4.0` (prototype pollution fix — needs `>=3.4.2` once released)
  - `undici@>=7.24.0` (security fix in HTTP client)
  - `yauzl@>=3.2.1` (zip parsing security fix)
  - `glob@>=11.0.0` (transitive glob update)
- Full `npm audit` reports 4 vulnerabilities in the toolchain:
  - `fast-xml-parser` high (entity expansion bypass via `@aws-sdk/xml-builder` via `wrangler`)
  - `flatted` high (prototype pollution — override partially effective; awaiting 3.4.2+)
  - `next` 2× moderate (HTTP smuggling + disk cache; production dep, fix pending upstream)
- Current full-audit status: 4 vulnerabilities (0 critical, 2 high, 2 moderate, 0 low).

## Design System

### Brand Colors

Three-tiered palette using `--color-brand-[name]-[shade]` CSS variables.

**Hunter Green (Primary):**

| Shade  | Hex       | CSS Variable                        | Tailwind Class              |
| ------ | --------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Core   | `#386851` | `--color-brand-hunter-green`        | `text-brand-primary`        |
| Light  | `#628F79` | `--color-brand-hunter-green-light`  | `text-brand-primary-light`  |
| Dark   | `#1E392C` | `--color-brand-hunter-green-dark`   | `text-brand-primary-dark`   |
| Deeper | `#12231b` | `--color-brand-hunter-green-darker` | `text-brand-primary-darker` |

> **Deeper** is the gradient terminus used in 22+ component files.
> Example: `from-brand-primary via-brand-primary-dark to-brand-primary-darker`

**Leather Tan (Secondary):**

| Shade | Hex       | CSS Variable                      | Tailwind Class               |
| ----- | --------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Core  | `#BD9264` | `--color-brand-leather-tan`       | `text-brand-secondary`       |
| Light | `#D9BD93` | `--color-brand-leather-tan-light` | `text-brand-secondary-light` |
| Dark  | `#8A6B49` | `--color-brand-leather-tan-dark`  | `text-brand-secondary-dark`  |

**Architectural Bronze (Accent — CTA borders & Featured labels):**

| Shade | Hex       | CSS Variable                 | Tailwind Class            |
| ----- | --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Core  | `#A87948` | `--color-brand-bronze`       | `text-brand-bronze`       |
| Light | `#CD9B6D` | `--color-brand-bronze-light` | `text-brand-bronze-light` |
| Dark  | `#6B4E2E` | `--color-brand-bronze-dark`  | `text-brand-bronze-dark`  |

> **Bronze usage:** Applied to CTA borders and Featured Project labels for a premium feel.
> For accessible body text, always use the Dark shade (contrast ≥ 7:1 on white).
> Note: `brand-bronze-light` is defined but currently unused in components — bronze gradients
> use the numeric scale (`bronze-600`, `bronze-700`, `bronze-800`) directly.

**Neutrals:**

- Light mode: White, Gray 50-900
- Dark mode: Gray 900-50 (inverted)

**Usage:**

```tsx
// Tailwind classes — primary (Hunter Green)
bg - brand - primary; // Hunter Green core
text - brand - primary - light; // Lighter tint (dark mode surfaces)
text - brand - primary - dark; // Deep shade (headings, high contrast)
text - brand - primary - darker; // Gradient terminus (to-brand-primary-darker)

// Secondary (Leather Tan)
bg - brand - secondary; // Leather Tan core (backgrounds, large text only)
text - brand - secondary - dark; // AA-compliant for body text (4.71:1)

// Accent (Architectural Bronze — CTA borders & featured labels)
border - brand - bronze; // CTA outline borders
bg - brand - bronze - dark; // Featured label backgrounds (7:1 on white)
text - brand - bronze - dark; // Accessible bronze text

// Dark mode variants
dark: bg - brand - primary - light;
dark: text - brand - secondary - light;
```
