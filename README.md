## 🎨 Brand Essentials

### Core Values - Six-Value Professional Foundation System

#### "Old School Business" — Where Your Word is Your Bond

**Trust-Centered Philosophy**: "Trust as our ultimate goal and measurable company foundation"

Our six core values build toward trust as the culmination of excellence in every interaction:

4. **Integrity** - Doing What's Right, Every Time

   - Making decisions that benefit clients, not our bottom line

5. **Innovation** - Modern Tools Meeting Traditional Values

### Core Slogan

#### "Building for the Client, NOT the Dollar"

_Where handshakes matter, promises are kept, and relationships last longer than buildings._

### Hero Section Tagline Strategy

Each page features a **unique, page-specific tagline** instead of repeating
"THE ROI IS THE RELATIONSHIP" across all hero sections. This approach:

- Reinforces each page's unique purpose and value proposition
- Reduces tagline fatigue and improves message retention
- Provides targeted messaging relevant to the page context
- Maintains brand consistency while adding variety

**Examples:**

- Homepage: "Where Vision Meets Execution"
- About: "Excellence Through Experience"
- Services: "Your project deserves expert oversight"
- Team: "Experience You Can Trust"

Complete guide:
[Slogan & Tagline Guide](./docs/branding/strategy/slogan-rotation-guide.md)

### Page-Specific Messaging (NEW - November 2025)

Each page group has its own unique voice and messaging strategy:

**7 Page Groups:**

1. **Traditional Business** (Home, Contact) - Main slogan prominence, old-school values
2. **Company Heritage** (About, Projects) - History, proven track record
3. **Future Vision** (Team, Services) - Growth, innovation, forward momentum
4. **Professional & Patriotic** (Government, Veterans) - Duty, service, compliance
5. **Recruitment** (Careers) - Enthusiastic, opportunity-focused
6. **Tech Innovation** (Automated Estimator, 3D Explorer) - Tech-savvy, cutting-edge
7. **Partnership & Urgency** (Trade Partners, Urgent) - **ROI-focused**
   (exclusive use of "THE ROI IS THE RELATIONSHIP")

**Key Principle:** "Building for the Client, NOT the Dollar" remains the PRIMARY SLOGAN
across all pages, but each group has supplementary messaging that speaks to its unique audience.

Complete guide:
[Page-Specific Messaging Guide](./docs/branding/strategy/page-specific-messaging-guide.md)

### Brand Colors

- **Hunter Green** (`#386851`) - Primary brand color
- **Leather Tan** (`#BD9264`) - Secondary/accent color
- **Bronze** (`#CD7F32`) - Accent highlights

Full color system: [Color System Guide](./docs/branding/standards/color-system.md)

### Typography

Responsive sizing with `clamp()` utilities for fluid typography across all devices.
See: [Typography Standards](./docs/branding/standards/typography.md)

### Icons

Material Icons via custom `<MaterialIcon />` component.
Complete reference: [Icons Hub](./docs/technical/design-system/icons/icons-index.md)

## 👨‍💻 Development Workflow

### 🎯 New to Development? Follow This Path

**Before writing any code**, follow the complete learning path:

1. **[Developer Workflow Pathway](./docs/development/developer-workflow-pathway.md)** - ⭐ **READ FIRST** -
   Complete step-by-step guide through all documentation
2. **Phase 1: Brand Foundation** (30-45 min) - Understand brand identity, messaging, and visual standards
3. **Phase 2: Implementation** (45-60 min) - Learn technical patterns and coding standards
4. **Phase 3: Page Development** (15-20 min) - Master the page creation workflow
5. **Phase 4: Specialized Topics** (as needed) - Deep dive into specific areas

### Creating New Pages

**Prerequisites**: Complete the [Developer Workflow Pathway](./docs/development/developer-workflow-pathway.md) first!

1. **Understand the brand** - Read [Page-Specific Messaging Guide](./docs/branding/strategy/page-specific-messaging-guide.md)
   to identify which of the 7 page groups your page belongs to
2. **Review standards** - Check [Homepage Compliance Checklist](./docs/branding/standards/homepage-compliance-checklist.md)
   for validation requirements
3. **Create page component** in `src/app/[route]/page.tsx`
4. **Add metadata export** with SEO information (see [SEO Complete Guide](./docs/technical/seo/seo-complete-guide.md))
5. **Update sitemap** in `src/app/sitemap.ts` with new route
6. **Use centralized utilities** from `src/lib/styles/` (see [Style Utilities Guide](./docs/development/style-utilities-guide.md))
7. **Test locally** with `npm run dev`
8. **Validate code quality** with `npm run type-check && npm run lint`
9. **Run SEO audit** with `npm run seo:audit`
10. **Use cohesion checklist** - Follow [Cohesion Checklist](./docs/development/cohesion-checklist.md)
    to ensure consistency

**Detailed Guide**: See [New Page Development Guide](./docs/development/new-page-development-guide.md)

### Code Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** - All code must pass strict type checking
- **Zero ESLint errors** - Clean linting required
- **Centralized utilities** - Use `cardStyles`, `gridLayouts`, `Section` components
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Performance** - Optimize bundle sizes and loading times

### Pattern Usage

**Use centralized patterns instead of inline styles:**

```tsx
import { cardStyles, gridLayouts } from "@/lib/styles/shared-styles";

// Grid layout
<div className={gridLayouts.threeColumnResponsive}>
  {items.map((item) => (
    <div key={item.id} className={cardStyles.base}>
      {/* Card content */}
    </div>
  ))}
</div>;
```

**Use Section components for consistent layouts:**

```tsx
import { Section, SectionHeader } from "@/components/ui";

<Section>
  <SectionHeader title="Section Title" subtitle="Optional subtitle" />
  {/* Section content */}
</Section>;
```

See: [Style Utilities Guide](./docs/development/style-utilities-guide.md)

### Before Committing

```bash
# Run all checks
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation
npm run lint          # ESLint check
npm run test          # Run test suite

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Failures:**

```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**TypeScript Errors:**

```bash
# Check for errors
npm run type-check

# Common fix: restart VS Code TypeScript server
# CMD/CTRL + Shift + P -> "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
```

**Database Connection Issues:**

```bash
# Verify D1 database exists
npx wrangler d1 list

# Test local database
npx wrangler d1 execute mh-construction-db --local --command="SELECT 1;"

# Check migrations
npx wrangler d1 execute mh-construction-db --local --command="SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';"
```

**Deployment Issues:**

```bash
# Verify Cloudflare authentication
npx wrangler whoami

# Check build output
npm run build:cloudflare

# Manual deployment
npx wrangler pages deploy .vercel/output/static --project-name=mh-construction
```

**Performance Issues:**

```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm run build:analyze

# Check for large dependencies
npm run bundle:size

# Profile build
npm run build:profile
```

### Getting Help

1. Check [MasterIndex](./docs/master-index.md) for relevant documentation
2. Review [Development Index](./docs/development/development-index.md)
3. Search existing documentation (163 files, well-organized)
