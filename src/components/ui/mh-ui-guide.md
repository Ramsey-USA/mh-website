## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Components

1. **Determine Category**: Choose appropriate directory based on component purpose
2. **Follow Naming**: Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `NewComponent.tsx`)
3. **Update Index**: Add export to main `index.ts` file
4. **Documentation**: Include component purpose in this guide

### Component Organization Rules

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component serves one clear purpose
- **Category Consistency**: Components in same category share similar patterns
- **Export Management**: All components available through main index
- **Import Hygiene**: Prefer index imports over direct paths

## Benefits

This organization maintains all existing functionality while providing a cleaner, more
maintainable structure for the UI component library.
