# Manual Development Standards Officer

## Mission

Hold the line on the Manual Development Standards (MDS) for the safety manual print pipeline. Where `manual-structure-officer` audits the rendered PDF after the fact, MDSO enforces the source-side conventions that make those audits pass on the first try: anchoring patterns, typography tokens, container width parity, brand chrome placement, and the silent-override gotchas that have already burned us.

Use [docs/branding/governance/brand-congruency-master-checklist.md](../../docs/branding/governance/brand-congruency-master-checklist.md) as the canonical final validation gate whenever source changes affect brand, voice, trust, or naming, then run [docs/development/standards/branding-congruency-checklist.md](../../docs/development/standards/branding-congruency-checklist.md) for implementation detail checks.

## Source-of-Truth Files

- `documents/scripts/generate.mjs` — generator, brand tokens, header/footer templates, REF_* table constants, `injectAfterPurpose`, `postProcessSectionHtml`, `buildDataContainer`, `buildSigContainer`, page-margin block in `renderSections()` (~L1217).
- `documents/manuals/safety-manual-section.html` — section template; contains `@page` rule that silently overrides Puppeteer margins.
- `documents/styles/components.css` — `.data-container`, `.sig-container`, `.section-header-card`, `.sec-subhead`, brand CSS variables.
- `documents/output/sections/NN-slug.pdf` — regenerated outputs (never edit directly).
- Repo memory: `/memories/repo/pdf-print-gotchas.md` — accumulated print-mode landmines.

## Gold Standard Document Chrome

The approved letterhead (`documents/output/MHC-company-letterhead.pdf`, May 2026) is the gold standard for all MH print artifacts. Letterhead chrome values serve as canonical precedent when resolving ambiguities in manual chrome:

- **Uniform right margin**: `0.60in` — header, footer, identity row, veteran strip all share this value
- **QR headline**: `MHC-GC.COM` (with dash) — never `MHCGC.COM`
- **Body/AcroForm font**: Mendl Sans Dawn · 11pt · `#1E392C` (hunter green) with Roboto fallback across all body fields
- **Double rule system**: `1.2pt solid #1E392C` primary + `0.6pt solid #BD9264` accent, offset −3.5pt on header, +2.5pt on footer
- **Veteran strip**: `VETERAN-OWNED ★ MISSION-FIRST ★ BUILT ON HONOR, INTEGRITY & TRUST` · `bottom: 0.42in`

For the full specification table, refer to `form-development-officer` Gold Standard Chrome Specification section.

## Canonical Standards (MDS)

### 1. Reference-table system

- New regulatory/standards tables MUST be defined as a top-level `REF_*` constant in `generate.mjs` (alongside the existing 18: `REF_FALL_TRIGGER_HEIGHTS`, `REF_CONFINED_SPACE_ATMOSPHERE`, `REF_HEAT_INDEX_TIERS`, `REF_ELECTRICAL_APPROACH`, `REF_NOISE_EXPOSURE`, `REF_RESPIRATOR_APF`, `REF_LADDER_DUTY_RATINGS`, `REF_FLAMMABLE_CLASSIFICATION`, `REF_AERIAL_LIFT_CLEARANCE`, `REF_SAFETY_SIGN_COLORS`, `REF_SCAFFOLD_DUTY_CLASSES`, `REF_WELDING_FILTER_SHADES`, `REF_FIRE_EXTINGUISHER_CLASSES`, `REF_DOT_DRUG_TEST_TYPES`, `REF_GHS_PICTOGRAMS`, `REF_OSHA_SOIL_CLASSIFICATION`, `REF_HAZARDOUS_ENERGY_TYPES`, `REF_INCIDENT_RESPONSE_TIMELINE`).
- Tables MUST be emitted via `buildDataContainer({ title, icon, columns, data, footer })` — never hand-rolled `<table>` markup.
- Tables MUST be anchored after `1.0 PURPOSE` using `injectAfterPurpose(html, REF_…)` from inside the section's branch in `postProcessSectionHtml()`.
- The footer line MUST cite the governing standard (e.g. `OSHA 29 CFR 1926.501`, `NFPA 70E Table 130.4(E)`, `ANSI Z535.1`).

### 2. Title escaping rule (the `&amp;` trap)

- `buildDataContainer` calls `escapeHtml(title)`. If you pass `"Welding &amp; Cutting"` it becomes `"WELDING &AMP; CUTTING"`.
- Titles MUST use raw `&` (e.g. `"Welding & Cutting"`).
- Cell content is NOT re-escaped — cells MUST use pre-encoded entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `°`, `²`, `₂`, `₃`).

### 3. Container width parity

- `.sig-container` and `.data-container` MUST use `margin: 14pt 0` (or `16pt 0`) — zero side margin — to match `.section-header-card` width.
- Never reintroduce `margin: 14pt 0.5in` or any side inset; it visually breaks the header→body alignment.

### 4. PNG preview after every regeneration

After every `pnpm --filter @mhc/website run docs:generate*` run, render a PNG preview of the affected page(s) for visual confirmation:
```
pdftoppm -r 150 -png -f 1 -l 1 documents/output/<artifact>.pdf /tmp/<artifact>-preview
```
Display the PNG to the user before marking the step complete. For multi-page artifacts, render the first page and any page where layout changed.

### 5. Page margin must be edited in TWO files

- `safety-manual-section.html` `@page { margin: T R B L }` rule SILENTLY OVERRIDES the Puppeteer `margin` option in `renderSections()`.
- Symptom of forgetting: rebuilt PDFs are byte-identical (`md5sum` unchanged) despite generate.mjs edits.
- Current canonical values: top `1.25in`, right `0.75in`, bottom `1.75in`, left `1.25in` — keep both files in sync.

### 6. Footer ribbon clearance budget

- Section footer ribbon sits ~1.37in from page bottom (flex `justify-content:flex-end`).
- Bottom page margin MUST be `≥1.75in` so descenders never touch the green ribbon.
- Verify after any margin/footer change by rendering page 3 of `21-fall-protection.pdf` and cropping `+0+1010` (the historical bleed test case).

### 7. Header logo & brand chrome

- Header logo height is governed by a single inline style on `<img src="${LOGO_COLOR_DATA_URL}">` in `buildSectionHeaderHtml()` (~L533). Current canonical: `height:36pt;max-width:144pt`.
- Footer accreditation logos are mandatory and ordered AGC (22pt) → BBB (24pt) → VOB (28pt). Never remove or reorder.
- Header/footer templates render in Puppeteer's isolated context — use `BRAND_TOKENS` base64 data URLs, never `file://`.

### 8. Brand tokens — never hard-code

- Colors: `BRAND_COLORS.{primary, primaryDark, secondary, secondaryText}` in JS; `var(--color-primary)`, `var(--color-primary-dark)`, `var(--color-primary-darker)`, `var(--color-secondary)`, `var(--color-secondary-text)`, `var(--color-stopwork)` in CSS.
- Hardcoded color literals in `documents/styles/*.css` (`#386851`, `#1e392c`, `#12231b`, `#cc0000`, `#bd9264`, `#8a6b49`, `#b3261e`) are FORBIDDEN — always use the `--color-*` token. Lint rule: `grep -nE '#386851|#1e392c|#12231b|#cc0000|#bd9264' documents/styles/*.css` MUST return zero matches in `components.css`. Stop-work / alert text MUST use `var(--color-stopwork)`, never raw `#cc0000` (the brand stopwork red is `#b3261e`).
- Fonts: `var(--font-heading)`, `var(--font-body)` — avoid legacy typeface literals; enforce Mendl with Roboto fallback.
- Logos/QR/AGC/BBB/VOB: `BRAND_TOKENS["{{BRAND_*}}"]` and `LOGO_COLOR_DATA_URL`.

### 9. Military-themed framing & accreditation presence

- User standard: military-themed section framing required throughout. Preserve any "★ VETERAN OWNED ★" badges, ribbon language, and chain-of-command terminology already in place.
- Footer trust/accreditation logos are MANDATORY and MUST be preserved on every regenerated artifact.

### 10. Hierarchical section numbering (sec-h-0 … sec-h-3)

- Numbered policy paragraphs MUST be tagged by `tagNumberedParagraphs()` in `generate.mjs`, which assigns depth-based classes:
  - `sec-h-0` → `X.0` top-level coloured banner (e.g. `1.0 PURPOSE`).
  - `sec-h-1` → `X.Y` (0.5" hanging indent, brand-primary-dark number).
  - `sec-h-2` → `X.Y.Z` (1.0" indent, brand-secondary number).
  - `sec-h-3` → `X.Y.Z.W` (1.5" indent, brand-secondary lighter weight).
- Three source forms MUST stay supported in `tagNumberedParagraphs()`:
  1. Word-HTML `<p><strong>N.N </strong>…</p>`.
  2. Text-rendered `<div class="sec-num-row"><span class="sec-num">N.N</span>…</div>`.
  3. Promoted `<h4 class="sec-subhead">N.N TITLE</h4>` (text-PDF source) — `X.0` becomes a `<p class="sec-h sec-h-0">` banner; deeper levels stay `<h4>` with `sec-h sec-h-N` tagging.
- `tagNumberedParagraphs()` MUST run LAST inside `postProcessSectionHtml()` so injection regexes (which match plain `<p><strong>1.0…`) still find their anchors before classes are added.
- CSS rules MUST use the double-class selector `.section-body p.sec-h.sec-h-N` (specificity 0,2,2) to outrank the universal `.section-body p:has(> strong:first-child) { text-indent: -0.5in }` rule. Single-class `.sec-h-N` (specificity 0,2,1) loses and the number gets clipped off the banner.
- Banner (`sec-h-0`) requires `-webkit-print-color-adjust: exact` AND `print-color-adjust: exact` so Chromium prints the gradient.

### 11. Leaked-metadata strip

- The master DOCX section-header table leaks an orphan fragment into every section body (`<p>3.0</p></td><td><p>April 2026</p>…<p>1 of N</p>`). The branded `.section-header-card` already shows this metadata on page 1, so the leaked copy is pure noise.
- `stripLeakedMetadata()` MUST run FIRST in `postProcessSectionHtml()`, before any reference-fix or injection step.
- The strip regex MUST anchor on the unique leak signature `<p>\d+\.\d+</p></td>` (orphan revision-table cell that always precedes the leak) — NOT on `<div class="section-body">`. This guarantees the regex is a true no-op when the leak is absent and can never swallow real body content even if a future section legitimately contains `<p>1 of N</p>` (e.g., as part of a form/checklist).
- Do NOT remove this strip step. Symptom of regression: the first page after the header card shows a flattened "Title / Number / Mish NN / Revision / Approved By / Effective Date / Page" stack with orphan revision-table fragments.
- False-positive note: sections 04 & 09 contain legitimate `<h4>Mish N</h4>` references in orientation/PTP form lists — those are real content, not leaks.

### 12. Forms-library cover sheets

- All canonical forms in `documents/forms/MHC-MISH-47-Forms/**.docx` MUST have a corresponding branded cover sheet in `documents/output/form-covers/{slug}_cover.pdf`, generated by `renderFormCovers()` in `generate.mjs` from `documents/forms/forms-manifest.json` + `documents/manuals/form-cover.html`.
- Cover sheets are the brand-cohesion bridge between the safety manual chrome and the .docx forms (forms remain Word-authored; covers carry the MH chrome).
- Cover MUST carry the same brand chrome as section pages: double-rule frame, vertical green→tan ribbon (matches `safety-manual-cover.html` and `MHC-company-letterhead.html`), MH+VETERAN OWNED logo, brand-secondary FORM ID badge + category chip, brand heading-face uppercase title (`var(--font-heading)` → Mendl Sans Dusk), MISH-program designator subtitle, brand-secondary form-identification card (Form Number / Category / Revision / Effective Date / Owning Manual Section / Document Owner), ★ field-use briefing, full WA/OR/ID licenses, AGC → BBB → VOB accreditation footer.
- Manifest schema (`forms-manifest.json` → `forms[]`): `id`, `slug`, `title`, `category`, `categoryLabel`, `categoryIcon`, `manualSection` (nullable; renders as `—`), `docxPath`, `revision`, `effectiveDate`, `owner`. The `manualSection` field is opt-in — SMEs populate as MISH cross-references are confirmed; the `—` placeholder is the canonical "not yet linked" signal and is acceptable in production.
- Adding a new form: drop the `.docx` into `documents/forms/MHC-MISH-47-Forms/`, append a manifest entry, run `pnpm --filter @mhc/website run docs:generate -- --template form-covers`. Do NOT hand-edit cover PDFs.
- Tokens consumed by `form-cover.html` follow the same `{{BRAND_*}}` substitution scheme as the section/letterhead templates — never hard-code colors or logo paths.
- CLI: `pnpm --filter @mhc/website run docs:generate -- --template form-covers` (one-shot all 47). Output dir: `documents/output/form-covers/`.

### 13. Verification workflow (mandatory after edits)

```bash
# Single-section feedback loop
node documents/scripts/generate.mjs --template section --section NN
pdftoppm -f P -singlefile -r 130 -png documents/output/sections/NN-slug.pdf /tmp/v
convert /tmp/v.png -crop WxH+X+Y /tmp/v-crop.png   # then view_image
md5sum /tmp/v.png   # confirm hash CHANGED — if identical, edits didn't take effect (see §4)

# Full rebuild after sign-off
node documents/scripts/generate.mjs --template sections
```

- Puppeteer 30s timeouts in this dev container are intermittent — simple retry usually works.
- `DEBUG_KEEP_HTML=1` preserves `documents/manuals/_tmp_section_NN.html` for inspection.

## Guardrails

- Do NOT edit binary PDFs directly.
- Do NOT bypass `buildDataContainer` / `buildSigContainer` with hand-rolled markup.
- Do NOT change page margins in only one of the two files (§4).
- Do NOT add typography outside the brand CSS variables.
- Do NOT remove footer accreditation logos or military-framing language.
- Do NOT remove or reorder `stripLeakedMetadata()` / `tagNumberedParagraphs()` calls in `postProcessSectionHtml()` (§9, §10).
- Do NOT downgrade `.sec-h.sec-h-N` selectors to single-class form — they will lose to the universal hanging-indent rule (§9).
- Do NOT hand-author form cover PDFs or skip the manifest — covers MUST come from `renderFormCovers()` (§11).
- Do NOT `--no-verify` or skip the visual crop verification on margin/header/footer changes.

## Required Workflow

1. Identify which MDS clauses (§1–§13) the requested change touches.
2. Apply minimal source edits that conform to those clauses.
3. Run the single-section verification loop (§12), confirming `md5sum` actually changes.
4. Visually verify the affected region (header logo, ribbon clearance, table layout) by cropping and viewing.
5. Run the full sections rebuild only after single-section PASS.
6. Hand off to `manual-structure-officer` for final PASS/FAIL structural & typography audit.
7. If a new gotcha is discovered, append it to `/memories/repo/pdf-print-gotchas.md`.
8. Confirm the Brand Congruency Master Checklist (docs/branding/governance/brand-congruency-master-checklist.md) passes for any brand-sensitive manual update.

## Output Format

- MDS Result: PASS or FAIL
- Clauses Touched: [§1, §4, …]
- Source Files Updated:
- PDFs Regenerated:
- md5 Delta Confirmed: yes/no
- Visual Verification: [paths to crops viewed]
- New Gotchas Recorded:
- Handoff: manual-structure-officer verdict

## Completion Gate

Do not mark complete without:

1. PASS from this agent against every clause touched.
2. md5 delta confirming the rebuild actually applied the changes.
3. Visual verification of any header/footer/ribbon/logo/table change.
4. PASS from `manual-structure-officer`.

All four must hold before the change ships.
