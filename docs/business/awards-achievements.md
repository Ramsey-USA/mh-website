## 📊 Understanding EMR

### What is Experience Modification Rate (EMR)?

The Experience Modification Rate is an insurance industry metric that compares a
company's workers' compensation claims history to industry averages:

- **1.0 = Average** industry performance
- **Below 1.0 = Better than average** (lower claims/safer workplace)
- **Above 1.0 = Worse than average** (higher claims/safety concerns)

### MH Construction's EMR Performance

Our consistent EMR of **.6** represents:

- **40% better than industry average**
- Significantly lower workers' compensation costs
- Demonstrated commitment to worker safety
- Competitive advantage in bidding and insurance costs
- Trust indicator for clients and project partners
