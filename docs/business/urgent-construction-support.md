# Urgent Construction Support Services

## Service Overview

MH Construction provides specialized urgent construction support to General Contractors and

emergency response service, we focus on providing expert consultation, specialized manpower,
heavy equipment with certified operators, and experienced crews to help resolve urgent

them as a subcontractor to solve the structural issues at their source - whether that's
damaged foundations, failing roofing systems, load-bearing problems, or other structural
issues causing secondary problems.
