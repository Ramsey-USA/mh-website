## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions ✅ COMPLETED

1. **Mark legacy component as deprecated** - Added JSDoc warnings
2. **Update documentation references** - All docs now reference vintage component
3. **Verify no active usage** - Confirmed only vintage component is used
4. **Fix performance issues** - Hover fuzziness resolved

### Future Considerations

1. **Consider removing deprecated component** after next major release
2. **Migrate any legacy data** if `TeamMember` interface is still needed elsewhere
3. **Consolidate data sources** if possible

## Testing Checklist
