# Perfect Markdown Template

This template follows ALL linting rules and prevents future errors.

## Essential Rules

### Blank Lines Around Headings

Always add blank lines before and after headings.

### Blank Lines Around Lists

Always add blank lines before and after lists:

- First item
- Second item
- Third item

Text continues here with proper spacing.

### Code Blocks

Always specify language for code blocks:

```javascript
function example() {
  return "language specified";
}
```

For diagrams or plain text use 'text':

```text
docs/
  templates/
    MARKDOWN_TEMPLATE.md
```

### Line Length

Keep lines under 80 characters. Break long sentences at natural word
boundaries to maintain readability.

## Document Structure

Follow this structure for consistency:

```text
# Title
## Overview
### Details
#### Sub-details
```

- Blank lines around all headings
