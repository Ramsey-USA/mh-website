# MH Construction Hero Section Standards

**Version:** 6.0.0  
**Date:** December 14, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Official Standard  
**Category:** Brand Standards - Hero Sections  
**Methodology:** Military/Construction Terminology Blend

**⭐ UPDATE (Dec 2025)**: Hero sections use **bottom-right text positioning** to allow photos/videos
to be the primary visual focal point. Text complements imagery rather than competing with it.

**⭐ MAJOR UPDATE (Dec 14, 2025)**: All hero taglines updated with military-construction terminology
blend to honor veteran leadership while maintaining construction expertise focus.

**⭐ DUAL NAMING SYSTEM (Dec 2025)**: Each hero section now includes dual naming format with
**Military Designation → Civilian Label** (e.g., "Base HQ → Home", "Our Oath → About Us") to
honor veteran identity while maintaining accessibility for all visitors.

## Quick Reference

This document defines the official MH Construction hero section standard implemented
across all website pages, with veteran-focused messaging, military operations terminology,
and visual-first design philosophy.

## 🎯 Tagline Strategy Update (December 14, 2025)

### Military/Construction Terminology Integration

Each hero section now features a **unique, page-specific tagline WITH military-construction
terminology blend** (December 2025 major update). This strategy:

- **Honors All Service Branches** - Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Space Force
- **Blends Military Operations Terminology** - Mission brief, SITREP, recon, deployment, tactical operations
- **Maintains Construction Expertise** - Technical capability, project delivery, quality craftsmanship
- **Reduces Generic Repetition** - Avoids overuse of single phrases
- **Reinforces Mission-First Philosophy** - "Building projects for the client, NOT the dollar"
- **Improves Message Retention** - Variety helps visitors remember key messages
- **Appeals to Veteran Clients** - Military-affiliated clients recognize authentic service language

### Implementation Guidelines (Updated December 2025)

**DO:**

- **Include dual naming format** - "Military Designation → Civilian Label" at top of each hero
- Blend military operations terminology with construction expertise naturally
- Honor all service branches (not just Army)
- Reflect the specific page's purpose with tactical clarity
- Keep taglines concise (5-12 words typically)
- Align with service-earned brand values (honesty, integrity, professionalism, thoroughness)
- Maintain core mission: "Building projects for the client, NOT the dollar"
- **Include unique page-specific mantra** for enhanced messaging and SEO

**DON'T:**

- Over-militarize at expense of construction expertise
- Favor one service branch over others
- Use military jargon without construction context
- Create generic taglines that could apply to any page
- Deviate from mission-first brand tone
- **Omit dual naming from hero sections** - it's now a required component

### Current Page-Specific Taglines (December 2025)

**Strategic Focus:** Award-winning website that attracts professional veterans through authentic
military-construction terminology and service-earned values.

**Dual Naming Format:** Each page includes "Military Designation → Civilian Label" for veteran
recognition and accessibility.

## 🚨 Critical Rules

### ✅ MUST INCLUDE

1. **Full Viewport Height**: `h-screen flex items-end justify-end` (bottom-right positioning)
2. **Visual-First Design**: Text positioned bottom-right to allow photos/videos to be focal point
3. **Multi-line Format**: Vertical text arrangement with separators for emphasis
4. **Veteran Messaging**: Emphasize veteran-owned, honest communication, proven craftsmanship
5. **PageNavigation at Bottom**: Section-based navigation using `#section-id` anchors (Dec 2025 standard)

### ❌ MUST NOT INCLUDE

1. **NO Badges**: Veteran badges, military_tech icons, decorative badges
2. **NO CTA Buttons**: Schedule Consultation, Get Estimate, Contact buttons
3. **NO Stats**: 30+ years, 100+ projects, satisfaction rate displays
4. **NO Trust Indicators**: Icons with project counts or ratings
5. **NO Contact Buttons**: Quick contact or phone buttons
6. **NO Additional Elements**: Keep it clean - title, subtitle, description only

## Standard Implementation

### Complete Hero Section Template (Bottom-Right Text Positioning)

**Design Philosophy**: Text in bottom-right allows background photos/videos to be the primary
visual element. This creates a more impactful first impression where imagery speaks first.

```tsx
<section className="relative h-screen flex items-end justify-end text-white overflow-hidden">
  {/* Background - Photo or Video Focal Point */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 via-brand-primary to-gray-900">
    {/* Add background image or video here */}
    {/* <img src="/path/to/image.jpg" alt="" className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover" /> */}
    {/* <video autoPlay loop muted playsInline className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full object-cover" /> */}

    {/* Overlay for text readability */}
    <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-brand-primary/30 via-gray-900/60 to-gray-900/80"></div>
  </div>

  {/* Header Text - Bottom Right (Allows visual to dominate) */}
  <div className="relative z-30 mb-20 mr-4 sm:mr-6 lg:mr-8 xl:mr-12 ml-auto max-w-2xl pointer-events-none pb-2">
    <h1 className="text-right text-base xs:text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl xl:text-4xl font-bold text-white drop-shadow-2xl leading-relaxed">
      {/* DUAL NAMING - Military → Civilian (Required) */}
      <span className="block text-brand-secondary/80 text-sm sm:text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl font-normal mb-2">
        Base HQ → Home
      </span>
      {/* PAGE-SPECIFIC MANTRA */}
      <span className="block text-brand-secondary text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl mb-4">
        Your Tri-Cities Construction Command Center
      </span>
      {/* TAGLINE WITH SEPARATORS */}
      <span className="block text-brand-secondary">
        Veteran-Owned Excellence
      </span>
      <span className="block">|</span>
      <span className="block text-white/95">Mission-Focused Execution</span>
      <span className="block">|</span>
      <span className="block text-brand-primary">Proven Craftsmanship</span>
      <span className="block">|</span>
      <span className="block text-white/90">
        Building Projects for the Client, NOT the Dollar
      </span>
    </h1>
  </div>

  {/* Page-Specific Navigation Bar - ALWAYS AT BOTTOM */}
  <PageNavigation
    items={navigationConfigs.home}
    className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0"
  />
</section>
```

## Typography Scaling (Bottom-Right Text)

### Responsive Size Guide

| Element           | Mobile      | Tablet       | Desktop       |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| **Multi-line H1** | `text-base` | `sm:text-xl` | `xl:text-4xl` |

### Full Responsive Classes (Right-Aligned)

```tsx
// Multi-line heading with vertical format
className="text-right text-base xs:text-lg sm:text-xl md:text-2xl lg:text-3xl xl:text-4xl font-bold text-white drop-shadow-2xl leading-relaxed"

// Individual lines with different accent colors
<span className="block text-brand-secondary">Line 1</span>
<span className="block">|</span>  // Separator
<span className="block text-white/95">Line 2</span>
```
