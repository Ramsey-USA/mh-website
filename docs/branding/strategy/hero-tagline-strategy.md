## 📝 Creating New Hero Taglines

### Guidelines for New Pages

When creating a new page, develop a unique hero tagline following these principles:

#### Length

- **Target:** 3-7 words
- **Why:** Short enough to be memorable, long enough to convey meaning
- **Examples:** 4-5 words is optimal sweet spot

#### Relevance

- Must directly relate to the page's primary purpose
- Should communicate the page's unique value
- Cannot be generic enough to work on any page

#### Brand Alignment

- Reflects MH Construction values (integrity, partnership, quality)
- Maintains professional, confident tone
- Appropriate for construction industry context

#### Clarity

- Immediately understandable without explanation
- No jargon or insider language
- Works for both industry professionals and general public

#### Uniqueness

- Different from all existing page taglines
- Memorable and distinctive
- Cannot be confused with other pages

### Creation Process

**Step 1: Define Page Purpose**

Write one sentence: "This page exists to..."

**Step 2: Identify Key Value**

What's the ONE main benefit visitors get from this page?

**Step 3: Draft 5-10 Options**

Create multiple variations focusing on different angles.

**Step 4: Apply Criteria**

Check each option against:

- Length (3-7 words?)
- Relevance (page-specific?)
- Brand alignment (matches tone?)
- Clarity (immediately clear?)
- Uniqueness (different from others?)

**Step 5: Test & Refine**

Ask 3-5 people:

- What does this tagline mean to you?
- What would you expect from a page with this tagline?
- Is this memorable?

**Step 6: Document**

Add to this guide with strategy explanation.
