## 🎯 Purpose

This guide provides MH Construction's complete slogan library WITH dedicated hero section
tagline strategy to:

- **Maintain consistency** by locking in specific slogans for each page
- **Reduce tagline fatigue** by using unique hero taglines per page (NEW November 2025)
- **Target specific audiences** with context-appropriate messaging
- **Reinforce page purpose** with dedicated, memorable taglines
- **Build recognition** through consistent page-specific slogans

### Major Update - November 11, 2025

**Hero Section Tagline Strategy:** Each page now features a unique, page-specific tagline
in its hero section instead of repeating "THE ROI IS THE RELATIONSHIP" across all pages.

**Why This Change?**

- Reduces overuse of a single phrase (tagline fatigue)
- Improves message retention through variety
- Reinforces each page's unique purpose
- Maintains brand consistency while adding contextual relevance

**Where "THE ROI IS THE RELATIONSHIP" Still Belongs:**

- Body content and value propositions
- Testimonials and relationship discussions
- Team pages and culture sections
- Partnership philosophy explanations
- About sections and company history

Just not repeated in every single hero section.

### Assignment Strategy

**Tier 1 (Foundation Slogans):** Can be reused across multiple pages - core brand messages
**Tier 2-5 (Specialized Slogans):** Dedicated to specific pages - unique to each context
**Hero Taglines:** NEW - Unique to each page's hero section only
