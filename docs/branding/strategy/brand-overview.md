from [core-values.md](../../business/core-values.md). All brand identity is built upon our 4 core values
in hierarchical order: **Honesty, Integrity, Professionalism, Thoroughness**—culminating in **Trust** as
our ultimate goal. These 4 values create 6 measurable differences clients experience.

**Transformation Summary**: Removed 50+ instances of "AI-powered", "cutting-edge", "innovative" language.
Replaced with emphasis on veteran values, proven craftsmanship, honest communication, and face-to-face
consultation. All tools and automation removed in favor of direct human relationships.
