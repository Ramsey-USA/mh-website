## 🎯 Purpose

This guide defines the **unique voice, tone, and messaging strategy** for each page group on the
MH Construction website. As a **veteran-owned business built on honesty and integrity**, we speak plainly,
act transparently, and prioritize substance over style. While our **four-value professional foundation system**
(Honesty, Integrity, Professionalism, Thoroughness) remains constant, each page group reflects these values
in ways that resonate with its specific audience.

**Core Identity:** Veteran-owned since January 2025. Your word is your bond — so is ours.

### Core Foundation

**Four-Value Professional Foundation System:**

- Trust is our ultimate goal and measurable company foundation
- Each of the four core values builds toward trust
- Trust is earned, measurable, and foundational to everything we do

### Core Principle

**"Building projects for the client, NOT the dollar"** is our PRIMARY SLOGAN and should be prominently
featured across the site. However, each page group also has freedom to create and use
supplementary messaging that speaks to its unique purpose while always reflecting our four core values.

### 🔗 Related Standards

specific terms and phrases.
