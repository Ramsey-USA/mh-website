## 🎯 Purpose

This guide defines the **unique voice, tone, and messaging strategy** for each page group on the
MH Construction website. While our core values remain constant, each page group has its own
personality and communication style designed to resonate with its specific audience.

### Core Principle

**"Building for the Client, NOT the Dollar"** is our PRIMARY SLOGAN and should be prominently
featured across the site. However, each page group also has freedom to create and use
supplementary messaging that speaks to its unique purpose.
