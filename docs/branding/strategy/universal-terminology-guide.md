## 🎯 Purpose

This guide defines **universal language and terminology standards** that should be used consistently across all MH
Construction communications—website, marketing materials, proposals, emails, and verbal communications. These
standards ensure brand coherence and professional consistency company-wide.

### Core Principle

**Consistency builds trust.** When we use the same terms the same way across all touchpoints, we strengthen our
brand identity and make our message clearer to clients, partners, and team members.

---

## 📖 TERMINOLOGY CATEGORIES

### 1. PARTNERSHIP LANGUAGE

#### **Client Partners** (PREFERRED - UNIVERSAL STANDARD)

**Definition:** Businesses, organizations, or individuals who hire MH Construction for project work. They are the
project owners/decision-makers.

**When to Use:**

- Referring to current or past clients
- Describing client relationships
- Marketing to potential clients
- Throughout all website pages
- In proposals and communications

**Approved Variations:**

- "Client Partner" (singular - PREFERRED)
- "Client Partners" (plural)
- "our Client Partners"
- "Client Partner relationships"

**Examples of Correct Usage:**

```text
✅ "What Our Client Partners Say"
✅ "Building trust with every Client Partner"
✅ "Client Partner success is our success"
✅ "We work WITH our Client Partners"
✅ "Client Partner Testimonials"
```

**FORBIDDEN Terms (DO NOT USE):**

- ❌ "clients" (too transactional, lacks relationship emphasis)
- ❌ "customers" (retail language, not appropriate for B2B construction)
- ❌ "partners" alone (ambiguous - could mean trade partners or clients)
- ❌ "clientele" (too formal/pretentious)
- ❌ "patrons" (incorrect industry usage)

---

#### **Trade Partners** (DISTINCT FROM CLIENT PARTNERS)

**Definition:** Subcontractors, vendors, suppliers, and industry professionals we collaborate with on projects.
They are NOT the client.

**When to Use:**

- Referring to subcontractors/vendors
- Trade Partners page specifically
- Describing supply chain relationships
- In contractor network communications

**Approved Variations:**

- "Trade Partner" (singular)
- "Trade Partners" (plural)
- "our Trade Partners"
- "trusted Trade Partners"
- "Trade Partner network"

**Examples of Correct Usage:**

```text
✅ "Join our Trade Partner network"
✅ "We treat Trade Partners with respect"
✅ "Certified Trade Partners"
✅ "Building relationships with Trade Partners"
```

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

- **Client Partners** = Those who HIRE us (project owners)
- **Trade Partners** = Those we HIRE or work alongside (subcontractors/vendors)

**Never interchange these terms.** Using "Trade Partners" when referring to clients, or "Client Partners" when
referring to subcontractors creates confusion.

---

#### **Partnership Process & Collaboration**

**PREFERRED Phrases:**

- "work WITH you" (emphasizes collaboration)
- "partnership approach"
- "collaborative excellence"
- "Partnership Unity"
- "Partnership Success"
- "partnership-focused"
- "partnership company"

**FORBIDDEN Phrases:**

- ❌ "work FOR you" (implies subservience, not partnership)
- ❌ "service provider" (too transactional)
- ❌ "vendor relationship" (diminishes partnership)

**Context Examples:**

```text
✅ "We work WITH you to achieve your vision"
✅ "Partnership-focused management services"
✅ "Collaborative excellence in every project"
✅ "Partnership Unity drives our team"
```

---
