# Service Cards Layout Fix - Bottom-Aligned "Learn More" Links

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Issue:** Inconsistent positioning of "Learn More" links in Showcase of Services section  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

## Problem

The "Learn More" links in the Showcase of Services section appeared at different vertical positions across the six service cards due to varying content lengths. This created visual inconsistency and reduced the professional appearance of the section.

### Cards Affected

- Construction Management
- Master Planning
- Commercial Buildings
- Medical Facilities
- Light Industrial
- Tenant Improvements

## Solution

Applied flexbox layout to ensure "Learn More" links are consistently positioned at the bottom of each card, regardless of content length.

### Changes Made

**File:** `src/app/page.tsx`

#### For Each Service Card (6 total)

**Before:**

```tsx
<div className="relative">
  <div className="...">Icon</div>
  <h3>Title</h3>
  <p className="mb-6">Description</p>
  <div className="...">Learn More</div>
</div>
```text

**After:**

```tsx
<div className="relative flex flex-col h-full">
  <div className="...">Icon</div>
  <h3>Title</h3>
  <p className="mb-6 flex-grow">Description</p>
  <div className="mt-auto ...">Learn More</div>
</div>
```text

### Key CSS Classes Applied

1. **`flex flex-col h-full`** on inner container
   - Establishes vertical flexbox layout
   - Fills full height of card

2. **`flex-grow`** on description paragraph
   - Allows description to expand and fill available space
   - Pushes "Learn More" link to bottom

3. **`mt-auto`** on "Learn More" link container
   - Auto top margin pushes element to bottom
   - Creates consistent bottom alignment

## Visual Result

All six service cards now display their "Learn More" links at the same vertical position (bottom of card), creating a clean, professional grid layout with visual consistency.

### Benefits

✅ **Visual Consistency** - All links aligned at same height  
✅ **Professional Appearance** - Clean, organized grid  
✅ **Responsive** - Works across all screen sizes  
✅ **Scalable** - Content can vary without breaking layout  
✅ **Maintains Hover Effects** - All existing animations preserved

## Technical Details

### CSS Flexbox Strategy

Container (h-full)
├── Icon (fixed height)
├── Title (fixed height)  
├── Description (flex-grow) ← Expands to fill space
└── Learn More (mt-auto) ← Pushed to bottom
