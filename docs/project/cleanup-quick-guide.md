# Codebase Cleanup Quick Guide

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Ready for Execution

## 📋 Quick Summary

The codebase audit identified **~160 files** that need attention:

- **144 backup files** in `src/` directory (`.backup` extension)
- **6-7 test/demo routes** in production app structure
- **3 test files** in root/public directories
- **2-3 duplicate config files**
- **2 empty directories**

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Execute Safe Cleanup (Phase 1)

````bash
# Run the automated cleanup script
./scripts/cleanup/cleanup-phase1.sh

# Verify everything works
npm run build
npm run lint
git status
```text

### Review Test Routes (Phase 2)

```bash
# Review what will be removed first
ls -la src/app/test*
ls -la src/app/phase*-test

# Then run the cleanup script
./scripts/cleanup/cleanup-phase2.sh

# Verify everything works
npm run build
npm run dev
```text

### Consolidate Configs (Phase 3)

```bash
# This script compares files before removing
./scripts/cleanup/cleanup-phase3.sh

# Verify everything works
npm run build
npm run lint
```text

## 📖 Detailed Documentation

See **codebase-audit-report.md** for:

- Detailed analysis of each issue
- Risk assessment
- Manual cleanup instructions
- Rollback procedures

## 🎯 Expected Results

After completing all phases:

- ✅ ~160 fewer files
- ✅ Cleaner project structure
- ✅ No test routes in production
- ✅ Better organization
- ✅ Improved security

## ⚠️ Safety Notes

1. **All cleanup scripts create backups** before making changes
2. **Always test after each phase** with `npm run build`
3. **Commit before and after** each phase for easy rollback
4. **Phase 1 is safe** to run immediately
5. **Phases 2 & 3 require testing** before deploying

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions

If something breaks:

```bash
# Check the backup directory created by the script
ls -la backups/

# Restore from the latest backup
# (Each script tells you the exact command to restore)
```text
