### Adaptive Grid System Implementation

**Responsive Layout Solution:**

- **Small Screens** (< 640px): 3-column grid layout reduces vertical height by 25%
- **Medium+ Screens** (640px+): 2-column grid layout maintains optimal spacing  
- All 10 navigation items visible without scrolling on any device size
- Unified styling across all navigation links - no special CTA treatment

**Adaptive Navigation Layout:**

#### Small Screens - 3-Column Grid

| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Book Appt. | Home | About |
| Services | Team | Projects |
| Government | Partners | Careers |
| Contact | - | - |

#### Medium+ Screens - 2-Column Grid

| Col 1 | Col 2 |
|-------|-------|
| Book Appt. | Home |
| About | Services |
| Team | Projects |
| Government | Partners |
| Careers | Contact |

**Responsive Design Features:**

- **Adaptive Container**: `max-w-sm sm:max-w-md` (384px mobile, 448px desktop)
- **Responsive Grid**: `grid-cols-3 sm:grid-cols-2` with breakpoint transition
- **Scalable Spacing**: `gap-1.5 sm:gap-3` and `px-4 sm:px-6` padding
- **Responsive Cards**: `px-1.5 py-3 sm:px-4 sm:py-6` with `rounded-lg sm:rounded-xl`
- **Universal Controls**: Theme toggle and hamburger menu always visible
- **Smooth Transitions**: Seamless layout changes between breakpoints

## Next Steps (Recommendations)

### Active State Indicators

Consider adding active page highlighting:

```tsx
const pathname = usePathname()
className={pathname === '/services' ? 'text-white font-bold' : 'text-white'}
```

### Dropdown Menus

For future expansion, consider adding dropdowns:

- Services → List of service categories
- Projects → Filter by project type
- Government → DOE, Federal, State, Local

### Breadcrumbs

Add breadcrumb navigation on internal pages:

Home > Services > Master Planning

### Search Functionality

Consider adding search to hamburger menu:

```tsx
<input type="search" placeholder="Search pages..." />
```
