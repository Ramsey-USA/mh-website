## Next Steps (Recommendations)

### Active State Indicators

Consider adding active page highlighting:

```tsx
const pathname = usePathname()
className={pathname === '/services' ? 'text-white font-bold' : 'text-white'}
```

### Dropdown Menus

For future expansion, consider adding dropdowns:

- Services → List of service categories
- Projects → Filter by project type
- Government → DOE, Federal, State, Local

### Breadcrumbs

Add breadcrumb navigation on internal pages:

Home > Services > Master Planning

### Search Functionality

Consider adding search to hamburger menu:

```tsx
<input type="search" placeholder="Search pages..." />
```
