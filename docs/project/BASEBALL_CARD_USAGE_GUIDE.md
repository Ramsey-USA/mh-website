## üë• Adding New Team Members

### Step 1: Prepare Member Data

Create a new team member object in `/src/lib/data/team.ts`:

```typescript
{
  name: "John Smith",
  role: "Project Manager",
  department: "Project Management & Estimating",
  experienceYears: 8,
  specialties: ["Commercial Construction", "Project Planning", "Client Relations"],
  bio: "John brings 8 years of construction project management experience to MH Construction. He specializes in commercial projects and has successfully managed over 50 projects from conception to completion.",
  slug: "john-smith",
  active: true,
  avatar: "/images/team/john-smith.jpg",          // Optional
  veteranStatus: "Army Veteran"                   // Optional
}
```text

### Step 2: Add Member Photo (Optional)

1. Add high-quality photo to `/public/images/team/`
2. Use format: `firstname-lastname.jpg`
3. **Recommended specs**:
   - Square aspect ratio (1:1)
   - Minimum 256x256 pixels
   - Professional headshot
   - Good lighting and contrast

### Step 3: Deploy Changes

The page automatically updates with new team members. No additional code changes needed!

## üé® Customizing Card Appearance

### Standard vs Mascot Styling

The system automatically applies special styling for "Trigger" the mascot:

```typescript
// Mascot detection (automatic)
const isMascot = member.name === 'Trigger'

// Mascot gets special amber/orange theme
// All other team members get standard brand colors
```text

### Veteran Status Badges

Add military service recognition:

```typescript
veteranStatus: "Army Veteran"        // Green badge with military icon
veteranStatus: "Navy Veteran"        // Blue badge with anchor icon
veteranStatus: "Air Force Veteran"   // Sky blue with flight icon
veteranStatus: "Marine Veteran"      // Red badge with shield icon
veteranStatus: "Coast Guard Veteran" // Cyan badge with waves icon
veteranStatus: "Civilian Supporter"  // Amber badge with handshake icon
veteranStatus: "Retired Leadership"  // Purple badge with premium icon
```text

### Department Organization

Team members are automatically grouped by department:

1. **Executive Leadership**
2. **Project Management & Estimating**
3. **Site & Field Operations**
4. **Administration & Support**

To change grouping, update the `department` field.
