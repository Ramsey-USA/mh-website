- **Clarified active work**: Updated Phase 5 to reflect ongoing optimization nature
- **Future planning**: Updated Phase 8 to Phase 8.5 for advanced security integration

### ✅ Current Phase Status

#### Completed Phases

- **Phase 1-7**: Foundation through Testing & Deployment
- **Phase 8**: Security & Compliance (Core Implementation Complete)
  - 43 security tests passing (100% success rate)
  - Security score: 95/100
  - Enterprise-grade security implementation operational

#### Active Phases  

- **Phase 5**: Ongoing Performance Optimization & Content Updates

#### Planned Phases

- **Phase 8.5**: Advanced Security Integration (Firebase & Cloudflare) - Q1 2026
- **Phase 9**: Scalability & Infrastructure - Q2 2026
- **Phase 10**: Innovation & Future Features - Q3 2026+
