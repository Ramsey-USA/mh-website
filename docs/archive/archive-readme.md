### When to Archive

Archive documentation when:

- ✅ Project/phase is 100% complete
- ✅ Content has been superseded by better documentation

- ✅ File hasn't been updated in 6+ months and project is finished

### How to Archive

1. **Move file** to appropriate archive subdirectory
2. **Add archive notice** at top of file:

   ```markdown
   > **⚠️ ARCHIVED:** [Date] - [Reason]  
   > **Superseded By:** [Link to current documentation]  
   > **Preserved For:** Historical reference
   ```

3. **Update references** in active documentation
4. **Update this README** with new archived file

### Archive Notice Template

```markdown
> **⚠️ ARCHIVED:** November 10, 2025 - [Phase/Project completed]  
> **Status:** Historical reference only  
> **Current Documentation:** See [Link]
