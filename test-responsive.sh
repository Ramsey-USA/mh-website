echo "Use browser DevTools to simulate different screen sizes:"
echo ""
echo "1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)"
echo "2. Click device toolbar icon (Ctrl+Shift+M)"
echo "3. Test each breakpoint listed above"

echo "üîß Common fixes for responsive issues:"
echo ""
echo "1. Horizontal scrolling:"
echo "   - Add 'overflow-x-hidden' to body/container"
echo "   - Use 'max-w-full' on wide elements"
echo "   - Check for fixed widths that exceed viewport"
echo ""
echo "2. Small touch targets:"
echo "   - Ensure buttons have min-height: 44px (h-11 or larger)"
echo "   - Use adequate padding on clickable elements"
echo "   - Add proper spacing between interactive elements"
echo ""
echo "3. Text readability:"
echo "   - Use responsive text classes: text-base md:text-lg lg:text-xl"
echo "   - Ensure minimum 16px font size on mobile"
echo "   - Check color contrast for accessibility"
echo ""
echo "4. Grid layouts:"
echo "   - Use mobile-first approach: grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3"
echo "   - Ensure proper gap spacing: gap-4 md:gap-6 lg:gap-8"
echo "   - Test grid collapse behavior"
echo ""
echo "5. Image responsiveness:"
echo "   - Use responsive image classes: w-full h-auto"
echo "   - Set max-width constraints"
echo "   - Use Next.js Image component with proper sizing"

echo "‚úÖ Test checklist for each page:"
echo "[ ] No horizontal scrolling at any breakpoint"
echo "[ ] All text is readable (minimum 16px)"
echo "[ ] All buttons are tappable (minimum 44px height)"
echo "[ ] Navigation works on all screen sizes"
echo "[ ] Images don't overflow containers"
echo "[ ] Grid layouts collapse properly"
echo "[ ] Content is accessible on all devices"
echo "[ ] Performance is good on mobile networks"
